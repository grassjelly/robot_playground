# robot_playground
 [Jackal](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/) Simulation running on Linorobot's Navigation Stack parameters.

This package creates a shim to Jackal's Gazebo simulator so you can run a virtual robot on Gazebo and try Linorobot's Navigation Stack parameters.

A forked [version](https://github.com/grassjelly/jackal) of Jackal is used so that the frames and topics on the virtual robot match Linorobot's. You can check out the following commits to see what changes have been made to make Jackal and Linorobot compatible.

- [remapping of Laser's 'front/scan' topic to 'scan' topic](https://github.com/grassjelly/jackal/commit/edf8c5cf8bd3ab2648ed4a37824995f624ee5ce2)
- [remapping of Laser's 'front_laser' frame to 'laser frame'](https://github.com/grassjelly/jackal/commit/505f6c324f3fcbdd11de7414aac37039dc8d8aa9)
- [remapping of Base's 'base_link' frame to 'base_footprint frame'](https://github.com/grassjelly/jackal/commit/6aaabba108f841097a35dd87aecfaf8b6b8d8be9)
- [defining 'base_footprint' frame as base_frame_id on jackal_velocity_controller](https://github.com/grassjelly/jackal/commit/423cfaa99db4b0cec3e8b72f30d3b9c5a38d8bd9)

## Installation

### Install dependencies:

    ./installdep

    cd ~/linorobot_ws/src
    
    git clone https://github.com/grassjelly/jackal.git
    git clone https://github.com/jackal/jackal_simulator.git
    git clone https://github.com/jackal/jackal_desktop.git

## Simulation
You can change the sensors used by uncommenting the sensors you need in bringup_sim.launch.

Running the virtual robot and Gazebo World:

    roslaunch robot_playground bringup_sim.launch

Once Jackal's simulation is up, you can run Linorobot's gmapping and autonomous navigation launch files as per normal.

Running gmapping demo:

    roslaunch linorobot slam.launch

Running autonomous navigation:

    roslaunch linorobot navigate.launch
